### What are you looking at?

A comprehensive demo project that uses the [Propactive](https://github.com/propactive/propactive#readme) framework to validate and generate property values on runtime. 

It demonstrates the ability to:
  - Create properties file using the JVM in a flexible manner.
  - Control which properties files to generate.
  - Plus validate property files on runtime with custom types.

The benefit of such approach is evident for enterprise microservices
that rely on multiple properties, and deployed to different environments.

For further details, see: [Propactive Framework's README](https://github.com/propactive/propactive#readme)
